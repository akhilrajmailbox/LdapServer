# LDAP Account Manager

LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a web frontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. The LDAP Account Manager tool was designed to make LDAP management as easy as possible for the user.

LAM ease administration of LDAP entries by abstracting the technical details of LDAP and allowing administrators and users without technical background to manage LDAP server. If needed, experienced users can directly edit LDAP entries via the integrated LDAP browser.

The latest LDAP server have `back-mdb` and old db configuration deprecated. `back-mdb` is the "primary" storage database backend. This backend manages directory objects in an embedded database and is more fully featured than other backends. `back-mdb` is superior to the deprecated `back-hdb` and `back-bdb` backends.
